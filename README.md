# HW 01 Refactoring 

## Description

In this project we were given the opportuniity to refactor a website for the marketing group: Horiseon,this project gave us a great oppurtunity to show us that even if you know a little bit of code you can always help improve. There were many ways to fix the problem for example you could group all the classes together into one CSS stlying element but I changed all the classes into the same name to reduce the number of lines.
